    "intro":"The third edition of the International School on Software Engineering intends to provide a contribution to PhD students and academic and industrial researchers on latest findings in the field of Software Engineering. The invited lecturers are internationally recognised research leaders and will cover very relevant topics for the scientific community, including Software Evolution, Source Code Analysis, Software Architectures, Software Product Lines, Software Testing, Autonomic Computing, Service Oriented Computing, and Web Services. The program of the school will aim at creating discussion forums between lecturers and industrial and academic attendees. Besides traditional tutorials, lab sessions will be included in the program. Submission of student talks and tool demos will also be encouraged to further stimulate the discussion.",
